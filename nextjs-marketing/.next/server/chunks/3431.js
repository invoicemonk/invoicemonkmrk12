Common formats include: simple sequential (001, 002, 003), date-based (2024-001), or client-prefixed (ABC-001). The key is consistency—never reuse invoice numbers."},{question:"When should I send an invoice?",answer:"For project work, send invoices immediately upon completion or at agreed milestones.

The sooner you invoice, the faster you get paid."},{question:"What payment terms should I use?",answer:"Common payment terms include Net 15, Net 30, or Due Upon Receipt.

Always remain professional and document all communications."},{question:"Should I offer early payment discounts?",answer:'Early payment discounts like "2/10 Net 30" (2% discount if paid within 10 days) can accelerate payments. However, calculate the effective annual cost—a 2% discount for 20 days early equals about 36% annually. It works best for high-margin businesses or when cash flow is critical.'},{question:"What payment methods should I accept?",answer:"Accept multiple methods to make paying easy: bank transfers (lowest fees), credit/debit cards (convenient for clients), and digital wallets like PayPal or Stripe.
